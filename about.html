            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Sasha Lamot, currently a Senior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science. 
                I have been heavily invested in learning more about computer science in general with a keen interest in algorithm theory and 
                optimization. Outside of class I have been part of a research lab developing software for nanotechnology experiments which includes a 
                simulation for e-beam lithography. I have also done internships where I was more focused on software engineering such as creating data 
                pipelines and large data analysis at IMEC, and optimizing and migration database systems at Apptweak.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also hold many interests outside computer science such as philospohy, photography, literature, art and making music.  
            </p>
